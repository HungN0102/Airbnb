### Database structured (SQL)
- The table listings, calendar and reviews are structured under a series of carefully considered criteria and splited according to the normalization rule and practicality of the database management.

- Gradient Boosted Algorithm with selected parameters achieved 0.7 R-Squared value which is considered to be substantial
- According to the variable importance of the gradient boosted algorithm, property type and neighbourhood have the largest impact on the price of the listing
